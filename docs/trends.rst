TrendS
=====


**TrendS** is a standalone subsystem part of the **CGRateS** infrastructure, designed to store *StatS* in a time-series-like database and calculate trend percentages based on their evolution.

Complete interaction with **TrendS** is possible via `CGRateS RPC APIs <https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cgrates/cgrates/apier@master/>`_.

Due it's real-time nature, **StatS** are designed towards high throughput being able to process thousands of *Events* per second. This is doable since each *StatQueue* is a very light object, held in memory and eventually backed up in *DataDB*.
